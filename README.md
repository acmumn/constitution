# Constitution

The ACM constitution and bylaws, now in LaTeX.

## Building

Download it and run `make`.
Then open `constitution.pdf` and/or `bylaws.pdf`.

## Making Changes

Fork the repo, make the changes you want, then submit a PR.
Officers vote on the PR (see 11.II.A of the Constitution or 7.A-C of the Bylaws), and if it's accepted, congrats, you've amended the constitution/bylaws!
