# Constitution

The ACM constitution, now in LaTeX.
Because it appears you people can't be trusted to format things properly.

## Building

Download it and run `make`.
Then open `constitution.pdf`.

## Making Changes

Fork the repo, make the changes you want, then submit a PR.
Officers vote on the PR (see 11.II.A), and if it's accepted, congrats, you've amended the constitution!
